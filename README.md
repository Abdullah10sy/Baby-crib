Project Title

Housing Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

Information

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple linear regression model that predicts housing prices based on selected input features. The model uses the popular scikit-learn library and demonstrates the full workflow: loading data, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

The solution illustrates how to:

Load and inspect structured tabular data using pandas.

Select feature columns and a target variable from a dataset.

Split the dataset into training and test subsets for unbiased evaluation.

Train a linear regression model.

Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Generate predictions on unseen test data.

This project is useful as a starter template for supervised learning regression problems and for understanding how regression modeling works in Python with real numerical data.

Objective

The primary objective of this repository is to demonstrate the implementation and evaluation of a linear regression model for predicting continuous outcomes (housing prices). Specifically, the goals are:

Data Preparation

Load a housing dataset from a CSV file.

Define input features and the target variable.

Model Development

Perform an 80/20 train/test split to simulate real-world prediction scenarios.

Build and train a LinearRegression model from scikit-learn.

Prediction and Evaluation

Use the trained model to predict housing prices on test data.

Quantify model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Reusability

Provide a clear, modular code structure that can be adapted for other regression tasks.

Allow users to swap features, models, or evaluation metrics with minimal changes.

By the end of this project, users will understand how to create, train, and evaluate a basic regression model in Python and how to document machine learning projects effectively in a GitHub repository.
